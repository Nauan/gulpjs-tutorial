After following the steps bellow, see the gulpfile.js on this repository to understand how to setup your own.

1. Install NodeJS and NPM (Node Package Manager): http://nodejs.org/download/
2. Install GulpJS (globally): run "npm install gulp -g"
3. Install GulpJS (in the project): In your project's directory, run "npm install gulp --save-dev"
4. Install plugins: Still in your project's directory, do the command: npm install <plugin-name> (Find plugins on the official GulpJS website: http://gulpjs.com/plugins/)
5. Write your gulpfile: Still in your project's directory (again), create the gulpfile.js file. In this one, you need to develop the functions according to the plugins that you have so far.
6. Use what you've done: In your project's directory, run: gulp <name-of-created-task>
